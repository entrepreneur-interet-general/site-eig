  » program is a way for governments to transform the administration from within.
  That is the reason why we have put together a memo on what we do, why we do it and
  how we do it.

Inspired by the [Presidential Innovation
 Fellows](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/), the “Public
 Interest Entrepreneurs” program seeks to inspire in return.
 
**Its ambition**: to champion the digital transformation of the government. 

**Its key principle**: during 10 months, a cohort of about 30 Public
Interest Entrepreneurs work within public administrations in teams of
2 or 3 on challenges linked to data and digital transformation.

All the rest –why we do it, how we do it and how we make it a
success - is in the memo. Enjoy the read!
