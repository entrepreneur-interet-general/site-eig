- question: "Who can participate?"
  reponse: "<p>The EIG program is open to anyone who has completed their university studies, with the exception of administrative staff and members of the panel (see the program regulations for further information).</p><p>Although we are mainly looking for applicants with a certain amount of experience (about 5 years), less experienced applicants who have already carried out entrepreneurial or associative projects are also welcome.</p>"

- question: "Can I telework on my challenge, either fully or partially?"
  reponse: "<p>The ability to work remotely varies from one administration to another. Most allow it and supervise it, but you will need to ask mentors during interviews. Keep in mind that challenges are team challenges and that proximity between EIGs is an important success factor.</p>"
  ancre: teletravail

- question: "Where do EIGs work?"
  reponse: "<p>EIGs work in teams, each located in the administration setting the challenge. The coaching program provides time for discussions between EIGs and a place where they can meet outside their administration, with the agreement of their mentors.</p>"
  ancre: lieu-de-travail

- question: "Où se situent les administrations d'accueil ?"
  reponse: "<p>La localisation des administrations d'accueil est indiquée en haut de la page de description des défis. Les défis de la promotion 4 se déroulent à Paris ou en région parisienne, à l'exception de Monitor Fish qui se déroule entre la région parisienne et le Morbihan (56).</p>"

- question: "Je suis en CDI, dois-je démissionner de mon poste actuel ?"
  reponse: "<p>Pas nécessairement. D’autres solutions existent, telles que le <a href=\"https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F10431\">congé sans solde</a>. Celui-ci nécessite cependant l’accord de votre employeur.</p>"
  ancre: demission-CDI

- question: "How is an EIG different from a service provider?"
  reponse: "<p>Unlike a service provider, EIGs do not work to precise specifications. They are in charge of their challenge and can propose changes to the project initially considered by the host administrations, if it seems to them that there are more appropriate ways of responding to the challenge they have been given, in terms of technologies or deliverables. During their immersion in administrations, EIGs are led to develop a roadmap on which they and their mentors work.</p>"

- question: "Is an EIG different from a 3-year fixed-term contract worker in administrations and if so how?"
  reponse: "<p>Unlike a conventional contract worker, EIGs work on a single project, and for 10 months. This allows them to work on a project from start to finish, from its design to its completion. Mentors are overseers of this format, allowing EIGs to get in touch with all those needed to complete the project.</p>"
  ancre: pas-un-contractuel-classique

- question: "What type of contract do EIGs have with their host administration?"
  reponse: "<p>EIGs, once selected, contact the host administration in order to sign a contract. The type is as follows: 10-month fixed-term contract with a salary of Euros 4000 net per month.</p>"
  ancre: contrat-administration

- question: "Why 10-month challenges?"
  reponse: "<p>The rules are clear: after 10 months, EIGs leave their host administration. This deadline puts healthy pressure on entrepreneurs to stay focused on the task at hand. This temporality, different from the one usually applicable in administrations, instils new methods and stimulates the project team's creativity and efficiency.</p>"
  ancre: pourquoi-dix-mois

- question: "Est-il possible de commencer plus tard que la date de début de la promotion ?"
  reponse: "<p>Malheureusement, pour des raisons administratives, nous n'avons pas de marge pour décaler le début de la promotion. Pour réduire votre délai de préavis (si vous démissionnez), vous pouvez demander à votre employeur une dispense partielle ou totale de préavis. Vous pouvez également envisager d’autres solutions, telles que le congé sans solde. Pour la promotion 4, plus de latitude est envisageable (mais pas garantie) pour les défis autofinancés (ADEX, Opérations 18, Enki, DataMed).</p>"
  ancre: commencer-plus-tard

- question: "At the end of 10 months, how are challenges put on a permanent footing?"
  reponse: "<p>Tools continue to be maintained and developed by host administration teams. Others are even deployed in other departments. In addition, the obligation, unless an exception is made, to release developments carried out as open source allows everyone to maintain them. The first promotion created an organization on Github to consolidate published repositories.</p>"

- question: "How are mentors prepared to greet the arrival of EIGs in their administration?"
  reponse: "<p>Before the arrival of EIGs, mentors are assisted by the Etalab team to prepare several stages: administration recruitment, work environment and scoping of the challenge (technical needs, methods, agility, etc.). They also participate in the promotion's mentoring sessions, so they can share their successes and difficulties.</p>"

- question: "What's the difference between Entrepreneurs d'Intérêt Général (EIG -public interest entrepreneurs) and Designers d'Intérêt Général (DIG - public interest designers)?"
  reponse: "<p>Every year since 2017, the EIG program has recruited a promotion of data scientists, developers and designers. They join administrations in multidisciplinary teams of 2 or 3, for a period of 10 months. Public interest designers are inspired by the EIG program. While the EIG program aims to recruit a variety of digital skills to solve challenges related to data flow and improving public policy, Public interest designers (DIGs) are particularly interested in improving user experience of online public services. Once recruited, DIGs join administrations according to various EIG procedures: they work alone or in twosomes and stay for a period of 6 to 12 months. The coaching of DIGs has been assigned to the EIG program; they thus join the community of the Public interest entrepreneurs program.</p>"
