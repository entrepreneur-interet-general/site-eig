- question: "What's the difference between Entrepreneurs d'Intérêt Général (EIG -public interest entrepreneurs) and Designers d'Intérêt Général (DIG - public interest designers)?"
  reponse: "<p>Every year since 2017, the EIG program has recruited a promotion of data scientists, developers and designers. They join administrations in multidisciplinary teams of 2 or 3, for a period of 10 months. Public interest designers are inspired by the EIG program. While the EIG program aims to recruit a variety of digital skills to solve challenges related to data flow and improving public policy, Public interest designers (DIGs) are particularly interested in improving user experience of online public services. Once recruited, DIGs join administrations according to various EIG procedures: they work alone or in twosomes and stay for a period of 6 to 12 months. The coaching of DIGs has been assigned to the EIG program; they thus join the community of the Public interest entrepreneurs program.</p>"
